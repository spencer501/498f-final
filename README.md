## **Introduction** 

For our final project for INFO 498F, we are looking at the 2016 Presidential Campaign Finance Expenditure Data. This dataset was collected by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which is an independent regulatory agency that discloses campaign finance information, contributions, and public funding for Presidential elections. This dataset includes the name of the candidates running, the amount of expenses, the date and location (city, state, zip, longitude, and latitude) of the transactions, and the category of expenses. Additionally, more information about the dataset can be found via this [link](http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do).

In our project, we will be summarizing financial information disclosed by presidential candidates who has reported at least $100,000 in contributions from individuals other than the candidate. Our main target audience is the general public who are interested in presidential campaign finances. However, other audiences may include other candidates, different interest groups, voters, donors, etc. who are interested in the expenditures of the candidates. 

Specifically, we are reading in reformatted version of a CSV file that contains the 2016 Presidential Campaign Finance (with the information listed previously). To display the data, we have created a Shiny app that allows the user to change how the data is displayed through interactive visualizations
